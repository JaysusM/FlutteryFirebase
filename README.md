# Flutter Firebase App
This is a simple Flutter app I have made in order to learn how Firebase works.

## What have I used?
· Firebase Authentication: Implemented gmail, facebook and anonymous login.<br>
· Firebase Storage: A logged user will be able to upload an image to the cloud.<br>
· Firebase Database: If the user is logged, he will be able to access a general realtime chat.<br>

### Running app
If you want to run the app you will need the google-services.json file inside android/app/ and add your facebook app id in android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
